# Get a smiple list of directory content
ls

# Get a long list (with details of permissions, date modified, owner ..etc)
ls -l

ls -la

# Getting help (short description of the tool and how to use it)
nmap -h
# OR
aircrack-ng --help

# Getting the manual page with full description of the tool and its options and usage
man aircrack-ng

# To search entire filesystem for a keyword, use locate (note: its database is updated once a day)
locate aircrack-ng

# Search for Binaries (gives binary location, and its source and manual page location if any)
whereis aircrack-ng

# Search for binaries in the PATH variable
which aircrack-ng

# Powerful search with find (allows for search in specific directory, specific owner, specific permissions, and wildcards)
# Search in the current dircetory (a single . refers to the current directory) for files (indicated by the type f) ending with .conf
# Wildcards include: * (match anything), ? (match a single character), [] (match any character listed wthining the brackets ex: [c,b]at)
find . -type f -name '*.conf'
# Search in the the configuration direcotry /etc for files whose names contain the keyword apache2
find /etc -type f -name apache2
# find files starting from root directory / that are owned by root user, and have the permission mode 777
find / -type f -user root -perm 777

# filtering text results by pipelining to grep (powerful text matching tool)
# filter the result of ps aux command (gives all running processes) to linex containing the keyword apache2
ps aux | grep apache2
# Another example for filtering listed files (include those containing the keyword notes)

# To set ip address and subnet mask (netmask) and broadcast address:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.154.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.154.255

# Spoofing MAC address of a particular NIC (changing it!!!):
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
sudo ifconfig eth0 up


# To reset IP address and request a fresh one from DHCP server:
dhclient eth0

# To check package availability in repostiories
